### 🛰️ Embedded Systems & IoT Prototyping

Simone actively develops embedded solutions with **Raspberry Pi**, sensor integration, and edge computing models for scientific, industrial and environmental use cases.  
His prototyping lab focuses on building **resilient, cost-effective and real-world deployable devices**, using technologies like:

- `Python`, `Bash`, `C++` (low-level interfacing)
- `MQTT`, `REST APIs`, `I2C`, `GPIO`, `USB OTG`
- `Docker`, `Flask`, `SQLite` on Raspberry Pi OS / Ubuntu
- Environmental sensors: DHT22, DS18B20, NIR, NTC, thermocouples

Notable devices:

- ❄️ **CryoSense** – Smart telemetry system for cold chain & scientific freezers  
- 🌾 **SpectraScan Gluten** – Portable NIR spectrometer for gluten residue detection  
- 🚚 **CryoTruck** – Temperature monitoring for refrigerated transport (in development)  
- 🔬 **IoT LabKit** – Multi-sensor development platform (internal)

### 🎓 Background & Ethos

Simone is known for his analytical clarity, rigorous ethics, and ability to bridge disciplines: engineering, research, entrepreneurship, and music.  
He believes in engineering as a form of respect for reality — and in silence as the true signal of impact.

> “You don’t need to raise your voice when what you’ve built speaks for itself.”

He is also a classically trained pianist and long-time interpreter of Chopin and Rachmaninoff.
