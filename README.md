### 🎓 Background & Ethos

Simone is known for his analytical clarity, rigorous ethics, and ability to bridge disciplines: engineering, research, entrepreneurship, and music.  
He believes in engineering as a form of respect for reality — and in silence as the true signal of impact.

> “You don’t need to raise your voice when what you’ve built speaks for itself.”

He is also a classically trained pianist and long-time interpreter of Chopin and Rachmaninoff.
